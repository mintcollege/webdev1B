    <h1>Extraordinary Web</h1>
    <p>by John Sume</p>

    <p>Sometimes it's the little things in web life that make us look twice. From carousels to documentation to cookie disclaimers, here are some sites taking the mundane and sprinkling in a little magic.</p>

    <p>Great ideas in web design come so thick and fast that it can be easy to miss them if you're not careful. This series is a small antidote to that, piecing together splashes of inspiration that caught our eye. Whether it's a mind-bending new feature or simply an old trick delivered with new elegance, they share the quality of making us think a little differently.</p>

    <p>I recently wrote a piece lauding the work of Saul Bass in the world of web design. One of his great gifts was making even the tiniest details beautiful. It is in that same spirit we kick off this series by honing in on website trends and features we've grown accustomed to being dull. As you'll see, they needn't be. The trick is often in the execution. Just about anything can be beautiful. Why aim for anything less?</p>

    <h2>Glasgow International's Pages Within Pages</h2>

    <p>On mobile, the same three sections form one big column. It's a savvy solution to the mobile/desktop relationship, and a pretty stylish one too. (Shout out to the 'Support' button, which starts spinning when you hover on it.)</p>
    <p>The CSS behind this is suitably simple. The three sections sit inside a flex container, with all three sharing the values of overflow-y: auto; and height: 100vh; so that they always fit the desktop viewport. The really nice touch here is using scrollbar-width: auto; to remove the sidebar. Because the columns take up the whole screen you intuitively work out the way the page works as soon as you move your mouse.</p>

    <h2>Kenta Toshikura's Dimension-Bending Portfolio</h2>

    <p>If in doubt, the tendency is to lean towards flat, modular arrangements, but maybe we should be thinking in three dimensions a little more often. This is a fantastic example of lateral thinking transforming what could easily have been a column of boxes into something truly memorable.</p>
    <p>We may not all be equipped to do something quite this fancy (I'm certainly not) but it's well worth remembering that web pages aren't blank canvases so much as they are windows into alternate dimensions.</p>

    <h2>Stripe Documentation Is The Teacher We All Want</h2>

    <p>I'm sure most of us have ground through enough bad documentation to appreciate the effort put into this approach. Clear, hierarchical navigation for the content, bite-sized step-by-step-copy, and of course the code snippets. Dynamic previews of code across multiple platforms and languages is above and beyond, but then why shouldn't it be?</p>
    <p>There are few things more valuable — and more elusive — than quality learning resources. Stripe shows there is a world of possibilities online beyond the standard words on a page. I've shared this before (and I'll share it again) but Write the Doc's documentation guide is a smashing resource for presenting informative content in useful, dynamic ways.</p>

    <h2>Max Böck's Technicolor Dream</h2>

    <p>Light and dark is the new normal, but as Böck himself writes in his blog post about the theme switcher, only Siths deal in absolutes. Through the magic CSS custom properties the site switches between color schemes seamlessly. For a full breakdown of how it works I heartily recommend reading the full post linked above. And for further reading on custom properties Smashing has plenty too:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"How To Configure Application Color Schemes With CSS Custom Properties" by Artur Basak</li>
        <li>"A Strategy Guide To CSS Custom Properties" by Michael Riethmuller</li>
    </ul>


    <p>The themes are named after Mario Kart 64 tracks, if you were wondering. Except Hacker News. That's named after Hacker News, with the marvellous touch of adding 'considered harmful' to the end of every single Böck blog post title.</p>
    <p>It's a fun twist on the traditional light/dark dichotomy, and also speaks to just how fluid sites can be
       nowadays. The same groundwork could allow you to adjust color schemes depending on where people are visiting the site from, for example.</p>

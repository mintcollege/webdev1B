        <div class="note">Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most
                       fascinating
              topics in the travel world. In February, we’re exploring the people, places and journeys working to make tourism more sustainable.</div>

        <p>Window or aisle? Near the lavatory or closer to the cockpit? Meal or no meal?</p>
        <p>When Gilbert Ott was specifying the booking of his overnight New York to London flight, he noticed something new in the list of meal preferences: in addition to options like a kosher or vegetarian meal, there was the choice to skip food service entirely.</p>
        <p>He duly chose no food. It’s something, he says, all air passengers should think about doing.</p>
        <p>“I skip meals no matter how I fly,” says Ott, who wrote about his experience on his blog, God Save the Points. “The idea of eating at midnight throws off your whole next day, and I think there’s credible science that it hurts your ability to recover from jet lag.”</p>
        <p>While not everyone is as thrilled with the prospect of skipping meals on board as Ott is, a few airlines, including Delta (which Ott was flying) and Japan Airlines (JAL), are using the “thanks but no thanks” option.</p>
        <p>The jury is still out on whether this will catch on with passengers long term.</p>

        <h2>Why meals matter</h2>
        <p>Currently, the “skip meal” option is only available to some passengers flying in Delta’s business class Delta One cabin. A rep from the airline tells CNN that since the program started last year, about 1,000-1,500 meals are voluntarily declined each month.</p>
        <p>That means only .3% of eligible passengers are opting out. But it’s a test case for what airlines could do to reduce fuel, costs and waste on board.</p>
        <p>According to airlines, the “no meals” option isn’t just about being eco-friendly. It’s also about personalization.</p>
        <p>“We’re always looking for ways to better serve our customers and create a more personalized onboard experience,” says a rep from Delta.</p>
        <p>Meals also represent an opportunity for airlines to gather more customer data and potentially better optimize catering options.</p>

        <h2>What if I change my mind?</h2>
        <p>Ott says the most common question he hears about the meal skip option is “what if I change my mind?” After all, when you’re in a metal tube in the sky, you can’t just pull over and grab a snack.</p>
        <p>Many airlines stock snacks on board, especially on long-haul flights. They’re not always free of charge, but the knowledge you won’t starve midair is valuable.</p>
        <p>If you’re sure of yourself and know what you like, Ott says any customization option is good.</p>
        <p>In Ott’s case, he flies the same JFK-Heathrow route at least once a month and has his travel routine down cold, from sleeping habits to what he stows in his carry-on.</p>
        <p>He also knows that he’ll continue to say “no thanks” to plane food, no matter how tempting it may seem.</p>
        <p>“The airline could have foie gras, lobster, and caviar and I’m still not going to eat it.”</p>
